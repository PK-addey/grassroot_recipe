        <h2> Description </h2>
            <p>
                Fufu is a pounded meal in West African Cuisine. It is a Twi
                word that originates from the Akans in Ghana. It is normally soft and 
                stretchy with a bland taste but it can also feel gummy depending
                on individual preferences. Although different ingredients are used 
                by different people, the main ingredients used in Ghana
                are cassava and plantain or yams. The cassava and unripe plantain 
                are peeled and boiled together. They are then pounded separately 
                with traditional wooden mortar and pestle or blended with a fufu
                blending machine.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the cassava and plantain are well mashed, they are mixed together. 
                The homogeneous mixture is then rolled into sizable balls and served
                with soup or sauce. In Ghana, it is mostly serve with light (pepper)
                soup. Yet it can also be served with goundnut soup, palm nut soup 
                or ebunuebunu (a local green vegetable soup). Fufu is regularly 
                eaten by hand. One has to tear off a small, bite-sized
                ball which is then dipped in soup, stew or sauce.

        <strong>Cassava and Plantain Fufu</strong>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    First, peel the plantain with a knife and cut it into cubes. 
                    Peel and scrape the cassava, de-string it and also cut into 
                    cubes.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Place the cassava and plantain into a saucepan, add 100ml of water, 
                    cover the pan and boil the content under medium heat for 20 minutes
                    or more depending on how hard the cassava is.   
                </li>

                <li>
                    While the cassava and plantain boils, wash the mortar and pestle.
                </li>

                <li>
                    When they are well cooked, strain off the water and leave 
                    the ingredients to cool to a temperature comfortable
                     enough to hold with the hand.  
                </li>

                <li>
                    Pound the plantain and cassava separately with the 
                    mortar and pestle into a fine sticky paste,
                    eliminating lumps as they form. 
                </li>

                <li>
                    Mix the pounded cassava and plantain together with
                    gentle pounding until a homogeneous mixture
                    of the two components called fufu is formed.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Roll the fufu into sizable balls.
