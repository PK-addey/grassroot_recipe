        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Ademe detsi is the Ewe rendition of jute mallow soup in English.
                It is a dish common to West Africa. Traditionally it is made with 
                a base of fish and seafood flavoured with fermented fish and lots
                of onions, pepper and red palm oil. The main ingredient of this 
                dish is the jute mallow leaves that give this dish its 
                signature texture and taste.
