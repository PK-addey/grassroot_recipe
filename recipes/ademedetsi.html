        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Ademe detsi is the Ewe rendition of jute mallow soup in English.
            It is a dish common to West Africa. Traditionally it is made with 
            a base of fish and seafood flavoured with fermented fish and lots of onions, 
            pepper and red palm oil. The main ingredient of this dish is the jute 
            mallow leaves that give this dish its signature texture and taste.
