            Palava is a word coined from the English word <em>palaver</em> which in turn is from a 
            Portuguese word that means idle chatter. However this word became the name of a popular 
            West African delicacy, no one knows. But the meaning of the name suggests that the delicious taste
            of the dish brought with it idle chatter by the people who ate it.</p>
