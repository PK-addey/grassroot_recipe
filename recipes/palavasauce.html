        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Palava is a word coined from the English word <em>palaver</em> 
                which in turn is from a Portuguese word that means idle chatter. 
                However this word became the name of a popular West African delicacy,
                no one knows. But the meaning of the name suggests that the delicious 
                taste of the dish brought with it idle chatter by the people who ate 
                it.

                This dish cannot be originally linked to any West African country.
